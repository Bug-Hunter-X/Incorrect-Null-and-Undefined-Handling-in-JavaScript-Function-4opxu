# Incorrect Null and Undefined Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions related to handling `null` and `undefined` values.  The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers, but it doesn't correctly handle cases where one or both arguments are `null` or `undefined`.

The bug is in the function's handling of null or undefined inputs.  It incorrectly assumes that returning `null` is the appropriate behavior in all cases. However, this can lead to unexpected results and break other parts of the application.

The solution demonstrates a more robust approach, using default values or alternative logic to handle such situations appropriately.
